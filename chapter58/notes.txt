in this chapter we will talk about react route render method 

react route render method
we will also talk about the difference betweeen render and component prop on react router.

render - makes the component mount just once , then re-render when required. the component stays in the background. in other words shouldComponentUpdate will run only once. Also because the component doesn't unmount, you may run into data leakage.

component - reinstiates the component on every visit (mounting and unmounting)

therefore, render props works best for functional components , while component prop will work best on class based component.
