understanding react fragment in react js


why there is need for react fragment if we have div element? 

when we use div in app.js render it adds that div element too inside the root div.

react fragments allows you to wrap multiple elements without adding an extra node to the dom.
this can be useful when rendering multiple child elements/components in a single parent component.
