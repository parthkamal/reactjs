in this chapter we will work on react router 

react router is very useful in single page application
react routher is useful for client side rendering 
in client side rendering , we get a bare html and js file from the server. 
first request may be slow in the csr, but after that everything becomes fast because it is executing inside the browser only 
with react router, we can create routes. without actually refreshing a page ( csr in single page application)

2. switch - it is like a switch (switch case statement) inside which all the conditions are matched 
3. route - it is like the routes ( each case of switch ) 


//index.js
ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
    </BrowserRouter>, 
    document.getElementById('root')
)

//App.js
function App() {
    return (
        <main>
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/" component={Home} exact />
                <Route path="/about" component={About} />

            </Switch>
