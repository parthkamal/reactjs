//context api

So, react hooks provides a concept call Context. 

//definition
React context api allows you to easily access data at different levels of the component tree, without passing prop at every level, 
(it can be said as a alternative of redux)

for example: 

let say ek data  hai x usko hmko pass karna hai from compnent a -> component c

for this , we need this create three function 

1. useContext() , this will create the context of x
2. provider(), this function will be used to provide the context
3. consumer(), kisi bhi component ko access karne ke liye, hame usko comsumer bnana pdega.
