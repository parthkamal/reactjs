in this chapter we will talk about events in react js 

Just like html - dom events , we can handle events in react js
Its just that the event will be changed to camel case, and the value will be passed my the executing function name only.

<button onclick =”foo()” >click  me </button>    (in html dom)
<button onClick = { foo } >click me </button>    (in react js)
