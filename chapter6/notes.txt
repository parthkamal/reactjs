//introduction to jsx in react


//jsx (javascript extension)


// in index.js when we remove react module - it says that module is required for jsx-scope

//jsx - whatever html like expression inside the react app gets converted to js finally. 
we can see that using the babel compiler. to use the jsx extension we require react module
